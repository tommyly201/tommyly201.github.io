Greetings! My name is Tommy Ly (pronounced l-ee) and I'm currently working towards obtaining my second bachelor's degree (read why [here](https://substack.com/home/post/p-153888551)!) in computer science & statistics from Columbia University. My primary goal is to work in the `ML + neuroscience/healthcare` area.

I spent the summer of 2022 working at the **[New York Genome Center](https://www.nygenome.org/labs/technology-innovation-lab/#overview)**, followed by the summer of 2023 working on gene regulation at the **[Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.rabadanlab.org/)**. 

Recently, I've been doing research in computational neuroscience at the **[Zuckerman Institute - Paninski Lab](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/liam-paninski-phd)** on pose estimation and neural decoding.

Fun fact: I'm been doing various triathlon races, and love the comedy scene in New York City. I enjoy film score, rock n roll music, and enjoy watching American classic movies during my free time!
