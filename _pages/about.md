Greetings! My name is Tommy Ly (pronounced l-ee) and I'm currently working towards obtaining my second bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. My primary goal is to work in the `ML + healthcare/biotech` area.

I worked in operations and data analytics at **[Uber Technologies](https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/)** for 4.5 years across Vietnam, Singapore, and New York City, and had the opportunity to be a part of Uber's expansion journey from just 5,000 employees in 2016 to its listing into a public company until 2020.

Similar to many others, the year 2020 brought a significant change in my life, and pushed me to reassess what I truly value. This reflection led me to the decision of pursuing another degree at **[Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/)**. I spent the summer of 2022 working on image processing at the **[New York Genome Center](https://www.nygenome.org/)**, followed by the summer of 2023 working on genetic expression prediction at the **[Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/)**.

Fun fact: I cycled across Vietnam covering 1087 miles in 14 days, finished **[Ironman 140.6](https://bettertriathlete.com/triathlon-distances/ironman/)** and took improv comedy lessons in New York City. I listen to **[Hans Zimmer](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0YC192cP3KPCRWx8zr8MfZ)**'s music to focus, enjoy watching **[American classic movies](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls074808109/)** during my free time, and a self-proclaimed rock-paper-scissors champion!
