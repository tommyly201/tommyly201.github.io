Greetings! My name is Tommy Ly and I'm currently working towards obtaining my second bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Columbia University. My primary goal is to work in the **[ML + healthcare/bio area](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Medicine-Artificial-Intelligence-Healthcare/dp/1541644638)**.

I worked in operations and data analytics at **[Uber Technologies](https://www.uber.com/us/en/about/)** for 4.5 years across Vietnam, Singapore, and New York City. I had the opportunity to be a part of Uber's expansion journey from just 5,000 employees in 2016 to its listing into a public company until 2020.

Similar to many others, the year 2020 brought a significant change in my life and restructured my priorities. This impactful year pushed me to reassess what I truly value and clarifying the importance of various elements in my life. This reflection led me to the decision of pursuing another degree at **[Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/)**, expecting to complete in 2025. I was privileged to devote the summer of 2022 to image processing at the **[New York Genome Center](https://www.nygenome.org/)**, followed by the summer of 2023 working on genetic expression prediction at the **[Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/)**.

Each year, I challenge myself with tasks I never thought were possible personally. Some of my accomplishments include cycling across Vietnam covering 1087 miles in 14 days, mastering swimming to the extent of finishing **[Ironman 140.6](https://bettertriathlete.com/triathlon-distances/ironman/)** within 2.5 years, and even taking improv comedy lessons in New York City. I also have a bucket list that comprises doing a standup comedy performance and exploring New York in the spirit of popular shows like **[How I Met Your Mother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/)**.

Fun-fact: I listen to **[Hans Zimmer](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0YC192cP3KPCRWx8zr8MfZ)**'s music to focus, enjoy watching **[American classic movies](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls074808109/)** during my free time and a self-proclaimed rock-paper-scissors champion!
